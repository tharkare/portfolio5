        <p>The Tillie S. Speyer house in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh PA is designed by James A. Speyer for his mother. Some aspects of this project was a physical model, plans done in floor, section, elevation, and axonometric. The model and case study presentations were done with two other group members. I focused on gathering information for the projects, while my group members focused on putting the information together. This was one of my favorite projects of the first semester, because it was the first case study we did and as a first year, I learned many useful skills in this project.</p>
